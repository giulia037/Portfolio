# Portfolio

For this activity I created my first portfolio. I started by creating a basic HTML file. After I created the HTML file I found some simple mock ups from other developers and adjusted the format to be my own personailzed website. Then I went on to create my CSS file. In my CSS file I created the layout for the way I wanted the page to look to the user.
